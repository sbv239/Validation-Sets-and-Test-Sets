# Validation Sets and Test Sets Exercise

In this exercise, we will explore the concept of validation sets and test sets by working with the California Housing dataset. We will use TensorFlow, Pandas library, and different strategies for splitting our data into validation and test sets. The goal is to understand the importance of these sets in the machine learning workflow and how they can impact model performance and generalization.

### Dataset: California Housing

The California Housing dataset is a popular dataset used for regression tasks. It contains various features related to housing in California, and the target variable is the median house value for California districts. We will use this dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow: You can install TensorFlow using pip:

`pip install tensorflow`

Pandas: You can install Pandas using pip:

`pip install pandas`

You can also use a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment of your choice for this exercise.
